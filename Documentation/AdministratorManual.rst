Administrator Manual
============================

Target group: **Administrators**

Describes how to manage the extension from an administrator point of view. That relates to Page/User TSconfig, permissions, configuration etc., which administrator level users have access to.

Language should be non / semi-technical, explaining, using small examples.


Installation
=============

After installation you can edit the extension settings

* pageID: either an integer value for the page id you want to display or a string
  pointing to an URL of your choice. If you choose the same domain as your
  backend login the user can make use of the admin panel and inline editing.
