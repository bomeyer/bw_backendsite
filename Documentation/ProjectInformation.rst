=====================
Project Information
=====================

This is a simple extension that simply displays a page in the Backend content 
frame.

I wanted to have a means of giving my editors latest information on the state of
the project, have the Style Guide attached as a download and even have some
Todo app for them to check off work to be done.

I imagined that all this functionality is already built into TYPO3, so why not
use it in the Backend as well?

I asked myself what these "Backend" pages are for and mused that they were exactly
created for this type of application.

To Do
-----------

Upcoming features are usually put on GitHub as "enhancements", but generally I
want to add the following plugins to the extension:

* Todo list app with Ajax connection (one of the many PHP/Javascript framework
  samples will do
* Integration of Trello and/or Microsoft Planner boards
