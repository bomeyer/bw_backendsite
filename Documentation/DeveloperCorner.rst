==================
Developer Corner
==================

Target group: **Developers**

There are already three identical modules for up to three different icons to be
placed in the Backend.

You can clone the project and duplicate the ModuleController classes to create
even more. Don't forget to add a registerModule call to ext_tables.php for each one.


Hooks
=======

There are no hooks. Simply not enough code to add some.
